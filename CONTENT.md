### Philosophy

Although painter Jamie Cain has been pursuing art for most of her life, it wasn't until the last five years that she decided to become a full-time artist. She has a unique philosophy of "Art as Lifestyle" — the idea of being present in the moment and taking notice of the nuances in our surroundings. From the shapes of clouds to the way light shines on someone's face, there's beauty all around us that we easily miss when we're distracted.
