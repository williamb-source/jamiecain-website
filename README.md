# Jamie Cain Fine Art - Website Rebuild

Demo rebuild of [jamiecain.com](https://www.jamiecain.com/) for GitHub Pages hosting.

## About the Artist

**Jamie Cain** is a fine artist and painter based in Jupiter, Florida. A Florida native, she paints with acrylic, oil, and gouache. Her beachtown roots have inspired her subject matter and style.

She paints abstracted landscapes, aerial cloud work, and figurative work. The skies and colors of Florida are a constant source of inspiration.

> "Art as a Lifestyle" — the idea of being present in the moment and taking notice of the nuances in our surroundings. From the shapes of clouds to the way light shines on someone's face, there's beauty all around us that we easily miss when we're distracted.
